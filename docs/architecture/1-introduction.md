# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **JSONSchema Validator for InterSystems IRIS**, including the ObjectScript core library, IRIS REST API layer, and Angular web application. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development.

This architecture differs from typical fullstack patterns due to the 100% native ObjectScript requirement - there are no Node.js backends or external language gateways. The IRIS platform provides both the runtime environment and web server capabilities.

**Starter Template:** N/A - Greenfield project
