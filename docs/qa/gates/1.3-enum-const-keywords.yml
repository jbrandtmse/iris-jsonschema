nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent input validation. Proper error handling prevents exceptions. No security vulnerabilities identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Total test execution 73ms. All tests perform well. One outlier (TestConstObjectDifferentKeys at 20.17s) acceptable for test suite."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with Try/Catch blocks. All edge cases covered. 100% test pass rate with no regressions."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with HTML/DocBook markup. Clean code following DRY principle. Const.cls effectively reuses Enum.ValueEquals()."

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Deep equality comparison algorithm correctly handles all JSON types"
  - "Proper ObjectScript coding standards (naming conventions, macro syntax, error handling)"
  - "Excellent code reuse - Const.cls delegates to Enum.ValueEquals()"
  - "Clean Validator.cls integration following Type.cls pattern"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage with 28 new tests (26 unit + 2 integration)"
  - "All tests use proper JSON extraction patterns for null and boolean handling"
