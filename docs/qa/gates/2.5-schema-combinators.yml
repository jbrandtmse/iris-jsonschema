# Code quality notes
code_quality:
  patterns_followed:
    - "Temporary context pattern for error isolation (anyOf/oneOf/not)"
    - "DocBook/HTML documentation comments"
    - "ObjectScript naming conventions (t/p prefixes)"
    - "Keyword class structure matching Object.cls, Array.cls"
  implementation_highlights:
    - "Combinator.cls: 4 ClassMethods with clear single responsibility"
    - "Validator.cls: Correct placement after boolean schema, before type checks"
    - "Error messages include diagnostic details (indices, match counts)"
